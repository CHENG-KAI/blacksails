  <p>This document discloses the privacy practices for Telegenic Apps (the "Apps") and Telegenic website (the "Site") (collectively referred to as the "Telegenic Services"), which are owned and operated by Black Sails Technology Inc. As part of the normal operation of the Telegenic Services, we may collect and, in some cases, disclose information about you. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you, how Telegenic Services may use such information, and what may happen to that information. By accepting the Terms of Use, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the Terms of Use for Telegenic Services.</p>

  <p>If you are a minor (under the age of 18), you can use this service only in conjunction with your parents or legal guardians. If you are a minor, please do not submit any personal information to this website. IF YOU ARE 13 YEARS OR YOUNGER, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE TELEGENIC SERVICES FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

  <p>Your Private Information. In order for you to use the Telegenic Service, we do NOT collect any personal identifiable information about you such as your name, address, phone number, email address, contacts nor do we collect any account information to any other apps or social networks. We DO however collect, store and process personal information provided by you directly if you chose to signup for our email newsletter, or if you mail or otherwise contact us for inquiries, feedback or other purposes. We may use such data to contact you for customer feedback or for sending you information about our Service.
Your Submitted Materials. If you choose to submit certain materials, including without limitation User Content and other associated information submitted under the Video Submission Agreement, we will collect such materials and information about you as you may choose to disclose pursuant to your activities when using the Telegenic Services.
Log Data. When you access the Service, our servers automatically record information that your browser or mobile phone sends whenever you visit a website or application (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, phone model, default language settings, or the webpage you were visiting before you came to the Site, pages or portions of the Telegenic Services that you visit or click on, the time spent on those pages, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Telegenic Service and for technical administration, to increase Telegenic Services functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our users’ needs. We do not treat Log Data as personal information or use it in association with other personal information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information to improve our service.</p>
  <p>Our primary goals in collecting user data and personal information are to provide and improve the TelegenicTM, its services, features and content and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate.
We aim to solely store necessary information and only for the shortest appropriate period of time. In addition, we take all the usual technical measures to prevent unauthorized access to your data on our servers.</p>
  <p>We use practices that are consistent with standards in our industry to protect your privacy. We cannot, however, promise that your personally identifiable information or private communications will remain private. For example, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications on our website. We do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party. The following describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable information may be disclosed.
Law Enforcement. We may disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.
Advertisers. We disclose aggregate information about our users to advertisers and for other marketing and promotional purposes. However, we do NOT disclose any personally identifying information to any of these entities.</p>
  <p>Telegenic Services may contain links to third party websites or services. We do not control the privacy policies of third parties. When you disclose information to third parties about yourself, you are subject to the privacy customs and policies of that third party. It is your responsibility to find out about the privacy policy of any such third parties.</p>
  <p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. For example, a change might be necessary, if we want to enhance the user experience with a new feature that is based on the additional collection or processing of data.
If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this Privacy Policy and, in some cases, provide you with additional notice (such as showing a notice on the Site or when you open an updated version of the Apps for the first time). We encourage you to review this Statement periodically to stay informed about our practices.
Whenever we make changes to this Privacy Policy, they are effective when the revised Privacy Policy is posted. Your continued use of the Telegenic Service after any changes of this Statement constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the new policy, please refrain from using the Telegenic Service and/or delete the Apps from your device.</p>
  <p>Your personal information and submitted materials may be transferred to – and maintained on – computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
